## Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools and frameworks to automate test execution, compare actual outcomes to expected outcomes, and generate test reports. This helps to increase efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of testing processes, as well as reducing the time and costs associated with manual testing. <br><br>In here we are going to test Automation Testing Website (https://automationexercise.com/). This project focuses on automating tests for the Automation Testing website using TestNG and Selenium.

## Test Cases

The test cases are written in the . Each test case covers various aspects of the Automation Exercise website, ensuring comprehensive coverage.<br><br>Please refer the Test Cases Excel for complete details -

## :warning: Note:
The tests have been run in chrome/edge in private mode, which blocks ads. However, it is possible that the test may not work in other browsers due to pop-up ads that require closing.
Tests are not always stable, because sometimes the ads are not blocked completely for some reason.
